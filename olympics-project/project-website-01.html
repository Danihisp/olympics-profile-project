                    During the last two editions of the Olympic Games, Switzerland has distinguished itself mainly in two sports. It won six of its 13 medals in cycling at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 and nine of its 14 medals in alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022. And most of these medals were won by women.
                    Is this an exceptional record in the history of Swiss sport at the Olympic Games? To find out let's draw the profile picture of the perfect Swiss medalist.

                        Seeking for a medal at the Olympic Games is probably the main goal for every athlete. However depending on where you come from, there are sports where the chances of winning a medal are greater.
                        As a Swiss athlete, alpine skiing offers the best chance of a medal. In all editions of the Olympic Games between 1896 and 2016 59 medals were won in Alpine skiing events.
                        Skiing is the national sport in Switzerland, so apparently this is not a surprise. Actually things are a little more complicated. The Swiss won their first medals in alpine skiing at the 1948 Olympics in St. Moritz, in... Switzerland.
                        However the rise of skiing in the country was precisely during the interwar period, as explained by a <a href="https://blog.nationalmuseum.ch/fr/2021/01/nation-du-ski-suisse/">Swiss historian</a>. Before that, it is the bobsleigh which brought the most medals to Switzerland.

                        Concerning the Summer Games only, it is gymnastics that offers the best chances of medals. The practice of gymnastics is old in Switzerland, as explains <a href="https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/fr/articles/016333/2021-01-15/">the Historical dictionary of Switzerland</a> It dates from the beginning of the 19th century. And the country has many gymnastics associations.
                        Other sports with a high medal potential are shooting, horseback riding and rowing, sports with a long tradition in the country. All together, these sports account for two-thirds of all medals won by Switzerland in history.

                    <p>
                    Swiss women athletes have participated in the Olympic Games almost from the beginning. It was at the summer games in Paris in 1900 that the first Swiss woman joined the delegation. The sailor Hélène de Pourtalès even won two medals on this occasion.
                    Concerning the winter games, it was at the St. Moritz Olympics in 1928, the second winter Olympics in history, that a woman was part of the Swiss delegation for the first time.
                    Nevertheless it was not until the second Olympics in St. Moritz in 1948 that the first Swiss woman won a medal thanks to the skier Hedy Schlunegger.

                    Men have won more medals than women. But the gender gap varies greatly from one sport to another. Skiing is the sport in which male and female athletes won almost the same number of medals. In equestrianism, male and female medal winners are also pretty much equal.
                    In the other successful Swiss sports, however, men were on the podium more often than women. Only one woman won a medal in gymnastics, although this is the second most successful sport for Switzerland.
                    The gender gap is even greater in rowing, where no Swiss woman has ever won a medal. Bobsleigh is an exception, as women's events have only existed since 2002.

                    The average age varies greatly from one sport to another. Of the six sports with the most medals for Switzerland, skiing has the youngest athletes. In contrast the shooting medallists are the oldest.

                    The youngest Swiss medalist, and one of the youngest in the history of the Olympic Games, is Hans Bourquin. He won the gold medal with his teammates in rowing in Amsterdam in 1928 at only 13 years old.
                    The oldest medal winner is a skipper. Louis Noverraz was 66 years old when he won silver in sailing at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico.
                    As for the winter games, the youngest Swiss medalist is Alina Müller. She won bronze with the ice hockey team in Sochi in 2014 just weeks before her 16th birthday.
                    The oldest medalist at the winter games is a bobsledder. Oscar Geier of Zurich was 49 years old when he won silver in the two-man bobsled at the 1932 Lake Placid Olympics.
